# PrimitiveDataTypesSolidity-Challenge

Write a smart contract that takes some ether from the user. Find out its value in units of:

wei
ether
gwei

Share your contract in our Discord channel for Module 3.

We know it is a bit vague and flexible. That's on purpose! Be creative and see what you can build.
